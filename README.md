## ❓ FAQ

### General
**Q: How do I update these builds?**
A: Since these are APKs, simply download the newer version and install it over the existing one.

**Q: Why can't I log in?**
A: Ensure **GmsCore/MicroG** is installed and that "Battery Optimization" is disabled for it in your Android settings.

### Playback & Issues
**Q: Videos are buffering or stopping after 1 minute?**
A: Go to **Settings > Anddea > Miscellaneous > Spoof streaming data** and enable it.

**Q: Why are video segments skipping automatically?**
A: This is **SponsorBlock**. It automatically skips intros, outros, and sponsors. You can customize this in **Settings > Anddea > SponsorBlock**.

**Q: Why doesn't the Download button work?**
A: Native downloading is a server-side Premium feature. You must use the "External Downloader" patch settings and link an app like NewPipe or YTDLnis.

**Q: I found a bug, will you fix it?**
A: These are dev builds based on upstream patches. If the bug is in the patch itself, it depends on the Anddea developers. I only compile the APKs manually for testing.
